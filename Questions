Company: Myntra

Role: Data Analyst

Round type: Use case Round

 

Problem Statement:

 

Given 2 teams of Myntra namely:

 

Finance Team: They focus to take decisions which are Money driven.
 

Customer Experience Team : They focus to improve the Customer Experience with Myntra.
 

Whenever Customer places a refund request Myntra can process it in 2 different ways:

 

Directly accept the Return request.
 

Put the request on hold and verify the product for damages or manhandling by customer. Only if the products are found to be in proper state, accept the return.
 

Now, there is a conflict of opinion between these two teams.

Finance Team likes the 2nd option as it minimize the chances of loss.

 

But Customer Experience teams likes the 1st option as their main aim is to improve Customer Experience.

 

Now suppose you are part of the Customer Experience team. How would you convince the Finance team to follow the 1st step.

 

What kind of Data you would be looking for solving this task.

 

Is there any need for model building for this use case.

Role: NLU Developer

 

Question1 :

Write a function that take two strings as inputs and return true if they are anagrams of each other and false otherwise

e.g.

(hello, hlleo) --> true

(hello, helo) --> false

 

Question 2 :

Write a function that take an array of strings "A" and an integer "n",

that return the list of all strings of length "n" from the array "A" that can be constructed

as the concatenation of two strings from the same array "A"

e.g.

A = [dog, tail, sky, or, hotdog, tailor, hot] and n=6

output should be "hotdog" and "tailor"

 

Question 3 :

Given an array "arr" of numbers and a starting number "x",

Find "x" such that the running sums of "x" and the elements of the array "arr" are never lower than 1.

e.g.

arr = [-2, 3, 1, -5].

The running sums will be x-2, x-2+3, x-2+3+1 and x-2+3+1-5.

So, the output should be 4.
